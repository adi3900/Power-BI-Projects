# 🏥 Patient Data Analysis using Power BI  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing patient data using **Microsoft Power BI** to uncover insights that help healthcare organizations improve decision-making, track patient outcomes, and optimize resource allocation.  

The dashboard provides a clear view of patient demographics, appointments, treatments, and overall healthcare performance.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, region).  
- Track appointment trends (attendance, cancellations, no-shows).  
- Visualize common diagnoses and treatments.  
- Monitor hospital/clinic performance metrics.  
- Provide actionable insights for data-driven healthcare decisions.  

---

## 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard  
- **Patient Demographics** → Gender distribution, age group segmentation.  
- **Appointment Trends** → Daily, weekly, monthly analysis of visits.  
- **Diagnosis & Treatment Patterns** → Most common illnesses, medications, and treatment types.  
- **Geographical Insights** → Patients by city/state for regional healthcare planning.  
- **KPI Cards** → Total patients, average visits, treatment success rates.  

---

## 🗂 Dataset  
- **Patient ID** – Unique identifier for each patient.  
- **Age & Gender** – Demographics.  
- **Diagnosis** – Reported health condition.  
- **Treatment** – Prescribed medication/procedure.  
- **Appointment Date** – Visit timeline.  
- **Outcome** – Treatment status (Ongoing, Recovered, Follow-up).  
- **Location** – City/State of the patient.  

*(Note: The dataset is anonymized and for learning purposes only.)*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI Desktop** – For building interactive dashboards.  
- **Excel / CSV** – Data source.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated measures and KPIs.

## 🚀 Steps to Reproduce  
1. Download the dataset (`patients_data.csv`).  
2. Open Power BI Desktop.  
3. Load the dataset into Power BI.  
4. Clean and transform data in **Power Query Editor**.  
5. Create relationships between tables (if applicable).  
6. Design visualizations and KPIs.  
7. Publish the dashboard to **Power BI Service** (optional).  

---

## 📈 Insights from the Dashboard  
- Majority of patients fall in the **25–40 years** age group.  
- **Cardiology** and **Diabetes** are among the most common diagnoses.  
- **No-show appointments** contribute to reduced efficiency.  
- Treatment success rate improves with **early diagnosis**.  

---

## 📌 Use Cases  
- **Hospital Management** → Track patient inflow/outflow.  
- **Doctors & Staff** → Identify high-risk patients and frequent diagnoses.  
- **Healthcare Policy Makers** → Plan resources and improve regional healthcare.
